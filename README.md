# Bank â€“ Microservices Demo Project

**Bank** is a Java-based microservices architecture project developed as part of my studies on *Microservices with Spring Boot, Docker, and Kubernetes*. The project explores how to build production-grade microservices using Spring Boot, Docker, and Kubernetes, supported by a full ecosystem of tools for monitoring, messaging, security, and service orchestration.
